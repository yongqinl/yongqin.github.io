Welcome! My name is Yongqin Lei, and I earned my PhD in Management Science at the Ivey Business School, University of Western Ontario. My research interests include behavioral operations management, two-sided platforms, and the operations-marketing interface.


Starting in July 2024, I will join the University of Winnipeg as an Assistant Professor in Operations and Supply Chain Management. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNe7PDFNZbSWAN1ox6WJETdUzFG9DUMs/view?usp=sharing).
